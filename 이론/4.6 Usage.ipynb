      "- 1 cup of rice\n",

      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and let it sit for 30 minutes.\n",
      "2. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the rice and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "3. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.\n",
      "4. In a separate bowl, mix the nuruk and yeast with a little bit of warm water to form a paste.\n",
      "5. Add the rice to the nuruk and yeast mixture and mix well.\n",
      "6. Transfer the mixture to a clean glass jar and cover with a clean cloth. Let it ferment in a dark, cool place for 1-2 weeks.\n",
      "7. After the fermentation process is complete, strain the liquid through a cheesecloth to remove any solids.\n",
      "8. Store the soju in a sealed container in the refrigerator and enjoy chilled. I am an AI digital assistant, so I do not have an age in the traditional sense. \n",
